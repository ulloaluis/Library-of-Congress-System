# Library-of-Congress-System
Interactive program for learning how to sort books based on call numbers defined by the LC system

See class docstrings for detailed information. 


Note:
Design is not the most efficient or the cleanest; I wrote this in a few hours so I could quickly get to studying, so I didn't put too much time into design (considering I was learning the system as I was writing the program). However, functionality is well-tested, so this program is suitable for testing. If you find any issues, please let me know.
